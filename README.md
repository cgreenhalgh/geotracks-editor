# Geotracks Editor

A web-based editor for creating geotracks, or more accurately geolists,
i.e. location-aligned music play lists.

Work in progress.

Initial plan: build initial editor as embeddable iframe using Angular.js
then integrate into Wordpress plugin over a custom post type. Export as
JSON aligned with design/editor requirements, and have external 
translations to (e.g.) daoplayer, DymoPlayer, AppFurnace.
